# MindTheGap
Hack The Pay Gap DC Hackathon
Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) Project - https://paygap.pif.gov/

This national hackathon tasked individuals of all demographics with a single mission, build a solution that will improve the gnder pay gap. Developers, designers, and data scientist collaborated in groups from different areas around the U.S. 

Each group was asked to focus on a specific topic:

Tools for workers.
Tools for companies.
Tools for the public.

Project #MindTheGap, also known as Gap Story, aimed to provide a simple tool for the public. The goal was to construct a basic one-page website that would allow professionals and students to share their stories of work place discriminiation and the steps they took to address the problem and overcome it. The site would also allow individuals to share and receive advice.

Given a short time period and small resources to build such products our web designer, Shannon Foster, strived to provide the most sufficient solution that also met the team's expectations.
